=== AutoBlogged Permalink Changer ===
Tags: AutoBlogged, Permalink, Link
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.1

Changes the permalink on AutoBlogged posts to point to the original article.

== Description ==

AutoBlogged automatically creates new blog posts for each item in an RSS feed. Normally, on index pages and RSS feeds clicking on the article title will take you to the local blog post that shows the imported feed item. This plugin will change that hyperlink so that it takes the user to the original article\'s URL. This plugin will only affect blog posts that contain a custom field named \"link\" which AutoBlogged automatically creates for each post it imports. This plugin will not affect any local blog posts that you write yourself. Note that AutoBlogged will still create posts locally, it is just the title permalink that will be changed by this plugin. This plugin will only modify permalinks for posts, it will not modify permalinks for pages, custom post types, or attachments.
