This project contains various add-ons for AutoBlogged. These addons function as
normal WordPress plugins and should be installed accordingly.

Note that these addons are experimental, proof-of-concept tools that do not 
not contain the level of error handling and logging that AutoBlogged has and 
has not been through the full QA process. Therefore we do not provide support 
for this code. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

We welcome any community involvment with this project.
